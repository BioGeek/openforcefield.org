We are excited to announce that the NIH has funded our Focused Technology Research & Development R01 proposal, 
enabling the Open Force Field Initiative to extend its work for small molecule force fields to also include biopolymers. 
This is a collaborative NIH grant shared over the five main academic sites (University of Colorado Boulder, Memorial Sloan 
Kettering Cancer Center, University of California, Irvine, University of California, San Diego, University of California, Davis), 
and includes significant collaborations with the MolSSI QCArchive and the AMBER community (via David Cerutti at Rutgers).
The submitted proposal text can be found here:

We especially thank partners that contributed letters in support of the proposal. 

The NIH funding is synertgistic to existing industrial Open Force Field Consortium funding, which focuses on delivering 
small molecule force fields with systematic improvements to accuracy and coverage, enabling us to deliver higher accuracy 
for protein-ligand binding free energies by allowing us to make systematic improvements to biopolymer parameters. 

In addition, this new funding will allow uus to develop a Bayesian inference infrastructure to automate the selection of 
functional forms and parameter types.

We look forward to working with existing force field developers to support existing general biomolecular force fields, 
generalizing our open force field toolkit to better support the range of existing force fields,
