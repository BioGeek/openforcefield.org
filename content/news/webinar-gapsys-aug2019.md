Vytautas Gapsys ([de Groot lab](https://www3.mpibpc.mpg.de/groups/de_groot/bgroot.html)) will be hosted by the [Mobley lab](https://mobleylab.org/) at UC Irvine, where he will give a talk on his work on benchmarking absolute, relative, and nonequilibrium binding free energy calculations on a fairly extensive set of protein-ligand systems, based on his recent [publication](https://doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.9b00590). Remote participants can join this seminar via [Zoom](https://ucihealth.zoom.us/j/163038806) in real time or watch later on YouTube.
