#### **Description**

We are pleased to announce the release of our first "Parsley" update. Version 1.1.0 "Parsley" is a minor release that includes some adjustments in force field: (1) Addition of three new bond and angle terms, `a22a`, `b14a` and `b36a`; (2) Modification of periodicity for N-N rotations; (3) Addition of missing improper torsions (`i2a`, `i3a`, `i3b`, `i5a`) with the associated torsions (`t51a`,`t51b`, `t51c`); and (4) Removal of redundant periodicity in `t19`.

#### **Datasets for parameterization**
 * [Roche set:](https://github.com/openforcefield/open-forcefield-data/tree/master/Torsion-Drives/Roche-Reference-Compounds): 686 1-D torsion profiles; 936 optimized geometries; 669 vibrational frequencies
 * [Coverage set:](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/tree/master/2019-06-25-smirnoff99Frost-coverage): 412 1-D torsion profiles; 842 optimized geometries; 265 vibrational frequencies
 * outside of the two molecule sets: 19 1-D torsion profiles


#### **Re-fitting Result**
Details of the re-fitting result can be found in [v1.1.0 release note](https://github.com/openforcefield/openforcefield-forcebalance/releases/tag/v1.1.0) 

* Modification of periodicity for N-N rotation introduces significant improvement in reproducing QM optimized geoemetries of molecules having conjugated N-N bonds.

</p>
* Addition of missing improper torsions and their associated torsions fixes the problem with reproducing QM optimized geometry of tetrazole.

#### **Benchmark Result**

Benchmark result shows that there is a slight improvement on reproducing QM optimized geometries and reproducing relative energies between conformers. Details of the benchmark result can be found in [v1.1.0 release note](https://github.com/openforcefield/openforcefield-forcebalance/releases/tag/v1.1.0).

the weighted root-mean-square error (WRMSE) of each molecule, which is weighted root-mean-square deviation  between internal coordinates of MM optimized geometry and QM optimized geometry was calculated for each parameter set then comparison of the WRMSE values was carried out.
