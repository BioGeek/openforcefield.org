## Open Force Field Initiative Postdoc

The **Open Force Field Initiative** is seeking talented postdoctoral fellows to work on the development of modern toolkits and new methods for building next-generation molecular mechanics force fields.
These positions are supported by the [Open Force Field Consortium](https://openforcefield.org/consortium/), which is administered by the [Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI)](http://molssi.org) and funded by an [alliance of pharmaceutical and biotech companies](https://openforcefield.org/news/introducing-the-consortium/) aiming to advance the state of force fields for biomolecular simulation and design through an open collaborative effort.
Postdocs will work closely with other researchers in the Initiative, multiple academic Initiative PIs, industry Partner scientific collaborators, and software scientists in the at [MolSSI](http://molssi.org) to develop and apply new algorithms and modern open source software infrastructure for building high quality biomolecular force fields.
We aim to publish frequently and openly---a sample of existing publications can be found [here](http://openforcefield.org/publications).

The [Open Force Field Initiative](http://openforcefield.org) is a multi-investigator collaboration that aims to build new, quantitatively accurate molecular mechanics force fields supported by a modern software infrastructure, built on principles of open source, open data, and open science. More about their scientific goals and plans can be found in the Open Force Field Initiative [Executive Summary](https://openforcefield.org/science/downloads/roadmap/open-forcefield-summary.pdf) or [Roadmap](https://openforcefield.org/science/downloads/roadmap/open-forcefield-plan.pdf).

#### Desired qualifications

* Experience with the theory and practice of atomistic biomolecular simulation using molecular mechanics force fields
* Comfortable with the Python programming language
* Exposure to [modern open source software development practices](https://github.com/choderalab/software-development) ([GitHub](http://github.org), unit tests, continuous integration)
* Good multidisciplinary teamwork and communication skills

#### Bonus qualifications (nice to have, but not required!)

* Experience with force field parameter fitting for small organic molecules
* Experience with quantum chemical calculations in general, and [psi4](http://www.psicode.org/) in particular
* Experience with high-performance computing clusters and/or cloud computing
* Knowledge of organic chemistry
* Experience with the open-source GPU-accelerated molecular simulation Python library [OpenMM](http://openmm.org)
* Experience with probabilistic programming languages (e.g. [PyMC](https://github.com/pymc-devs), [TensorFlow Probability](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/overview), [Pyro](http://pyro.ai/)) and/or machine learning frameworks like [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org) or [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* Experience with cheminformatics or computer-aided drug discovery

#### Location

Open Force Field Initiative postdocs will generally have flexibility in location, with potential sites including the participating investigator laboratories:

* [Michael K. Gilson](http://gilson.cloud.ucsd.edu/) (UCSD, La Jolla, CA)
* [John D. Chodera](http://choderalab.org) (MSKCC, New York City, NY)
* [Lee-Ping Wang](https://chemistry.ucdavis.edu/people/lee-ping-wang) (UCD, Davis, CA)
* [David L. Mobley](http://mobleylab.org) (UCI, Irvine, CA)
* [Michael R. Shirts](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/shirtsgroup/) (University of Colorado, Boulder, CO)

#### Appointment duration

The initial appointment will be for one year, with the potential for extension to multiple years to focus on other aspects of force field science and engineering. Position is pending final approval of funding.

#### Applying

Interested candidates should email an application to `info@openforcefield.org` with the subject line “Postdoc application” that includes:

* a cover letter explaining your motivation, background, and qualifications for the position
* a detailed Curriculum Vitae (including a list of publications)
* contact information of two references

## Other Available Postdoc Positions

#### [Postdoc position available in the Mobley lab](https://mobleylab.org/2019/11/18/postdoc-position-available-in-the-mobley-lab/)

Interested in improving predictive modeling of biomolecular interactions? [We](https://mobleylab.org/) seek a postdoc who will work on binding free energy methods and applications (likely including our BLUES method for enhanced sampling of ligand binding modes), as well as with the Open Force Field Initiative (OpenFF, openforcefield.org) on testing and improving biomolecular force fields, though this is not an OpenFF position. The candidate may also get involved with the SAMPL series of blind challenges, helping to drive progress in the field by facilitating comparisons of the latest methods on cutting-edge datasets in blind challenges we help design.

The ideal candidate will have a strong background in scientific software development, including with Python, experience with molecular dynamics simulations and method development (free energy calculations would be an additional plus!) and significant experience working as part of a team.

To apply, please send a cover letter explaining your interest in the position and your relevant background, along with a CV which also contains contact information for at least three references to me at `dmobley+postdoc@gmail.com`. This position will start as soon as a suitable candidate can be found, but applications should be received before mid-December, 2019.

#### [Two postdoc positions available in the Shirts lab](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/shirtsgroup/available-positions)

[The Shirts group](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/shirtsgroup/) has two job openings:

1. One postdoctoral position is to develop guidelines, based on fundamental physical principles, by which short nonbiological heteropolymers with sequence specificity can fold into secondary structure elements. This research will also help study what governs the relative stability between these allowed secondary structural elements. These initial studies will pave the way for more extensive and realistic modeling of the proposed heteropolymers, working with our experimental collaborators. This research effort is intended to build tools and theories for crafting human-engineered foldameric materials with a much larger range of properties and functions that occur in naturally occurring biological heteropolymers such as proteins. See the application page for more details: https://jobs.colorado.edu/jobs/JobDetail/Postdoctoral-Associate/22277.

2. A second postdoctoral position is to study the structure of nanostructured membranes formed by the self-assembly and polymerization of amphiphilic molecules as well as the mechanical properties of these membranes. These structural studies will be accompanied by study of the transport of small molecules in the nanochannels of these membranes. The mechanistic insights obtained in these studies will be used in collaboration with experimentalists to design and test new membranes that have high, chemically specific rejection of a range of solutes while maintaining high permeability of water. See the application page for more details: https://jobs.colorado.edu/jobs/JobDetail/Postdoctoral-Associate/22282.
