## **Open Force Field Initiative Software Scientist**

The **Open Force Field Initiative** is seeking a software scientist to work on the development of modern Python 
toolkits and new methods for building next-generation molecular mechanics force fields. 
The effort has been primarily funded by the [Open Force Field Consortium](https://openforcefield.org/consortium/) - an 
[alliance of pharmaceutical and biotech companies](https://openforcefield.org/news/introducing-the-consortium/) 
aiming to advance the state of force fields for 
biomolecular simulation and design through an open collaborative effort. The Software Scientist 
will work closely with other researchers in the Initiative, multiple academic Initiative PIs, 
industry Partner scientific collaborators, and software scientists at [MolSSI](http://molssi.org) 
to develop and apply 
new algorithms and modern open source software infrastructure for building high quality biomolecular 
force fields. We aim to publish frequently and openly—a sample of existing publications can be 
found [here](http://openforcefield.org/publications).

The [Open Force Field Initiative](http://openforcefield.org) is a multi-investigator collaboration 
that aims to build new, quantitatively accurate molecular mechanics force fields supported by a 
modern software infrastructure, built on principles of open source, open data, and open science. 
More about their scientific goals and plans can be found in the Open Force Field Initiative 
[Executive Summary](https://openforcefield.org/science/downloads/roadmap/open-forcefield-summary.pdf) or 
[Roadmap](https://openforcefield.org/science/downloads/roadmap/open-forcefield-plan.pdf).

#### Software Scientists at Open Force Field

Software Scientists on our team are high-level research engineers (often with a Ph.D.) with strong science, 
programming, and communication skills who can simultaneously tackle long-term development efforts and 
perform ongoing organizational duties. The desired qualifications for this role include significant 
experience with scientific software development (specifically Python), testing, documentation, and 
deployment, in addition to the “desired qualifications” for a postdoc. The software scientist is expected 
to perform duties ranging from working asynchronously and independently to implement major features, to 
closely collaborating with a team to produce a deliverable by a deadline. The Software Scientist’s effort 
will be divided approximately 50% to architecture, coding, and science, 25% to devops and user support, 
and 25% to management and programming guidance. Some specific examples of responsibilities include:

- Publishing [software releases and datasets with DOIs](https://zenodo.org/record/3541134#.Xd1xbb-IbOQ), 
  with clear documentation that references scholarly works and theory when applicable 
- Becoming the primary developer/maintainer for a core Python toolkit 
- Being a technical mentor to grad students and postdocs, performing code reviews, helping with 
  architecture decisions, and sharing modern software best practices 
- Working one-on-one with industry partners to install and make workflows using our software 
- Broadening our engagement with the open-source chemistry community 
- Leading regular science subproject meetings and writing 
  [blog posts](https://openforcefield.org/science/updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2019-10-17/) to 
  summarize progress 
- Representing Open Force Field at conferences and workshops 
- Traveling to [project labs](https://openforcefield.org/members/) as needed for focused in-person work 
- Debugging CI builds, dealing with conda packaging issues, and helping shepherd the eventual migration 
  of omnia packages to conda-forge 

The Software Scientist's effort will be acknowledged with coauthorship in publications featuring their work, though *primary authorship of papers or new scientific studies is not a major focus of the position*.

The position includes up to 15% travel, and the software scientist will be assigned a PI that they will 
report to on a regular basis, preferably in-person if geography allows. Our team is distributed over the US 
and Europe, which means that much of the work can be performed remotely, but also that meetings may fall 
outside of local working hours (we mostly operate on US East Coast time). The pay is comparable to a good 
industrial postdoc, we’re open to the idea of a large fraction of remote work, and everything the Software
Scientist produces will be open source under the MIT or CC-BY license.

##### Appointment duration

The initial appointment will be for one year, with the potential for extension to multiple years to focus 
on other aspects of force field science and engineering. Position is pending final approval of funding.

##### Applying

Interested candidates should email an application to `info@openforcefield.org` with the subject line 
“Software Scientist application” that includes:

- a cover letter explaining your motivation, background, and qualifications for the position 
- a detailed Curriculum Vitae (including a list of publications) 
- contact information of two references

#### Location

Open Force Field Initiative Software Scientists will generally have flexibility in location, with 
potential sites including the participating investigator laboratories:

* [Michael K. Gilson](http://gilson.cloud.ucsd.edu/) (UCSD, La Jolla, CA)
* [John D. Chodera](http://choderalab.org) (MSKCC, New York City, NY)
* [Lee-Ping Wang](https://chemistry.ucdavis.edu/people/lee-ping-wang) (UCD, Davis, CA)
* [David L. Mobley](http://mobleylab.org) (UCI, Irvine, CA)

<a id="shirts-postdocs"></a>

## [Two postdoc positions available in the Shirts lab](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/shirtsgroup/available-positions)

The [Shirts group](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/shirtsgroup/) has two job openings:

<a id="shirts-postdoc1"></a>

**1. Non-biological heteropolymers:** This postdoctoral position is to develop guidelines, based on fundamental physical principles, by which short non-biological heteropolymers with sequence specificity can fold into secondary structure elements. This research will also help study what governs the relative stability between these allowed secondary structural elements. These initial studies will pave the way for more extensive and realistic modeling of the proposed heteropolymers, working with our experimental collaborators. This research effort is intended to build tools and theories for crafting human-engineered foldameric materials with a much larger range of properties and functions that occur in naturally occurring biological heteropolymers such as proteins.

**Applications:** https://jobs.colorado.edu/jobs/JobDetail/Postdoctoral-Associate/22277

<a id="shirts-postdoc2"></a>

**2. Nanostructured membranes:** This postdoctoral position is to study the structure of nanostructured membranes formed by the self-assembly and polymerization of amphiphilic molecules as well as the mechanical properties of these membranes. These structural studies will be accompanied by study of the transport of small molecules in the nanochannels of these membranes. The mechanistic insights obtained in these studies will be used in collaboration with experimentalists to design and test new membranes that have high, chemically specific rejection of a range of solutes while maintaining high permeability of water.
