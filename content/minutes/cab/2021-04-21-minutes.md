The [Open Force Field Consortium Advisory Board](https://openforcefield.org/about/organization/#open-force-field-consortium) met on April 21, 2021.
The minutes are summarized as follows:

#### Refitting FFs via gradients of properties with respect to parameters

* Y. Zhao introduced the possibility of refitting gradients with TimeMachine. The goal is to be able to do end-to-end differentiable MM energy computations. This approach should allow for arbitrary gradients of system configurations with respect to basically anything.

#### 2021 OpenFF Annual Meeting

* K. Condic-Jurkic announced the 2021 OpenFF Annual Meeting. The virtual event will happen in early June.

#### OpenFF-1.3.1-alpha1

* D. Mobley announced the release of an alpha version of openff-1.3.1. This release fixes a problem with sulfonamides which was found by the OpenEye Scientific Software partners.
