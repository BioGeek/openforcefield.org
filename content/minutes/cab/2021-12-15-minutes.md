The [Open Force Field Consortium Advisory Board](https://openforcefield.org/about/organization/#open-force-field-consortium) met on December 15, 2021.
The minutes are summarized as follows:

#### Bespoke torsions

* Mark Mackey of Cresset reported on his efforts with the Cole lab to perform bespoke torsion fitting using ANI-2x as a reference. The results of free energy calculations using the bespoke parameters were mixed, and there was some discussion on how to prioritize further improvement of the methods.
* There was discussion about the interrelation of general force field training and bespoke force field training as they relate to protonation state enumeration.
