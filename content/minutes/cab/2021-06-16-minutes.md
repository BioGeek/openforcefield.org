The [Open Force Field Consortium Advisory Board](https://openforcefield.org/about/organization/#open-force-field-consortium) met on June 16, 2021.
The minutes are summarized as follows:

#### User support

* D. Mobley announced the creation of the support@openforcefield.org email address. This channel should be used exclusively for technical questions and support.

#### Progress reports

* D. Mobley announced that the team is working on producing our annual progress report. The aim is to help OpenFF advocates at our pharmaceutical industry partners to justify renewed funding for the Initiative.

#### OpenFE - final update/call for involvement

* D. Mobley announced that the Open Free Energy initiative is being launched. The team is currently wrapping up the legal review and the intention is to make the official launch later this summer (probably in late August). The OpenFE Initiative will be led by industry, not academics. Therefore, these groups will be more focused on meeting their own needs.
