The [Open Force Field Consortium Advisory Board](https://openforcefield.org/about/organization/#open-force-field-consortium) met on November 18, 2020.
The minutes are summarized as follows:

#### The Open Free Energy Consortium

* K. Condic-Jurkic and J. Chodera presented an overview about 'The Open Free Energy Consortium'.
* This new endeavor would be managed by a new overaching entity, which would act as a home for software scientists and other core folks.
* We hope that having this organization would make the current type of work we are doing easier, and simpler to expand. Also, it would allow us much more flexibility with a remote/international workforce.
* OpenFE would be independent from OpenFF, and with different goals, but would also share organizational staff and possibilly engineering/scientific efforts. 
 
#### Industry-led benchmarking studies

* G. Tresadern presented updates about Industry-led benchmarking studies.
