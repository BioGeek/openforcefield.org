The OpenFF team went through some changes in the first half of 2021 -- we are excited to welcome five new members to our team and to see some of our old teammates move on to exciting new roles.

We are very pleased to welcome the following new members:

 * [Josh Mitchell](http://linkedin.com/in/yoshanuikabundi) joined in February to help us improve our documentation and tutorials.
 * [Lily Wang](http://linkedin.com/in/lilyminium) joined in March as a Fulbright Fellow in the Mobley group and works on polymer force field infrastructure.
 * [Lorenzo D'Amore](http://linkedin.com/in/ldamore) joined in March as a dedicated OpenFF postdoc with Janssen to continue David Hahn's work on protein-ligand benchmarking.
 * [Iv√°n Pulido-Sanchez](http://github.com/ijpulidos) joined in April as a software scientist to assist with biopolymer infrastructure for 3 months.
 * [Andrew Dalke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dalke) joined in May as an independent consultant to work on the toolkit wrapper APIs and cheminformatics topics.

We are also incredibly grateful to [David Hahn](http://linkedin.com/in/davidfriedrichhahn), who was offered a permanent position with Janssen, and [Josh Fass](http://linkedin.com/in/joshuafass), who recently graduated in the Chodera lab and moved to Relay Therapeutics, for their effort and important contributions to the growing OpenFF body of work. Thank you both for being such wonderful teammates and valuable members of the OpenFF community, we are looking forward to your future successes!
