We're pleased to announce the [Open Force Field Consortium](consortium), a new academic-industry
collaboration to fund the initial activities of the Open Force Field Initiative.

### Press release

BLACKSBURG, Virginia, Sept 14, 2018 // -- The Molecular Software Sciences Institute ("The
MolSSI") announces the launch of The Open Force Field Consortium ("OpenFF Consortium"),
an academic-industry collaboration designed to improve computer models used to guide
pharmaceutical drug discovery. Formation of the consortium was driven by scientists from
MSKCC, UC Irvine, Bayer and GSK.

The effort focuses on improving the energy models, or force fields, used extensively in
computer-aided drug design. Modeling tools based on force fields assist development of
therapies for diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disease throughout academia
and industry. However, accuracy falls short of the mark in many cases. The OpenFF
Consortium focuses on changing that through automated development and improvement of new
force fields.

The Consortium stands out because of its open nature: All software, force fields, and
development tools are fully open source and broadly available, as the participating
organizations recognize that this infrastructure can and should help the entire field.
The Consortium focuses on development of an extensible, open source toolkit for constructing,
applying, and evaluating force fields; the curation of public datasets necessary to build high-
accuracy biomolecular force fields; and the generation of improved biomolecular force fields.
Academic and industry partners work together to ensure its success.

Consortium partners, both academic and commercial, bring a great deal of expertise to the
initiative. The Governing Board consists of five initial PIs plus two elected industry
representatives from the Advisory Board. The five PIs are John Chodera (Sloan Kettering
Institute), Michael K. Gilson (University of California, San Diego), David Mobley (University of
California, Irvine), Michael Shirts (University of Colorado, Boulder), Lee-Ping Wang (University
of California, Davis).

Commercial Partners provide the primary funding for the work. Initial partners are BASF, Bayer,
Boehringer Ingelheim, Relay Therapeutics, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Merck Group and XtalPi,
though opportunities remain open for more partners to join. OpenFF is also seeking potential
additional funding from foundations and federal agencies.

The MolSSI serves as a coordinating intermediary, and helps to ensure developed software
follows best practices as well as encouraging synergy with other open-source efforts within the
molecular sciences.

“By building a community around an open, modern, statistically-grounded toolkit for building and
applying molecular mechanics force fields from physical property and quantum chemical
datasets, we aim to democratize the construction of accurate force fields, as well as provide
tools to quantify the systematic error in their predictions,” said John D. Chodera (MSKCC).

“Force fields represent the foundation of molecular simulations and modeling -- a real
community resource. Everyone uses them, but improving them is an often unglamorous task.
We’re very excited that our industry partners recognize the importance of this problem and have
joined together to help support this important initiative, so that we can improve modeling as a
whole,” said David L. Mobley (UC Irvine).

### About the MolSSI

The computational molecular science community is a broad field that includes biomolecular
simulation, quantum chemistry, and materials science. The [Molecular Sciences Software
Institute (MolSSI)](http://molssi.org) exists to facilitate the advancement of software infrastructure, standards, and
best-practices in order to help the molecular sciences community attack larger and more
complex scientific challenges. Funded by the National Science Foundation, the MolSSI is
guided by its Board of Directors: T. Daniel Crawford (Virginia Tech), Cecilia Clementi (Rice
University), Robert J. Harrison (Stony Brook University), Teresa Head-Gordon (University of
California, Berkeley), Shantenu Jha (Rutgers University), Anna Krylov (University of Southern
California), Vijay Pande (Stanford University), and Theresa Windus (Iowa State University).
