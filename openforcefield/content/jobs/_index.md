The **Open Force Field Initiative** is seeking talented postdoctoral fellows to work on the development of modern toolkits and new methods for building next-generation molecular mechanics force fields.
These positions are supported by the [Open Force Field Consortium](https://openforcefield.org/consortium/), which is administered by the [Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI)](http://molssi.org) and funded by an [alliance of pharmaceutical and biotech companies](https://openforcefield.org/news/introducing-the-consortium/) aiming to advance the state of force fields for biomolecular simulation and design through an open collaborative effort.
Postdocs will work closely with other researchers in the Initiative, multiple academic Initiative PIs, industry Partner scientific collaborators, and software scientists in the at [MolSSI](http://molssi.org) to develop and apply new algorithms and modern open source software infrastructure for building high quality biomolecular force fields.
We aim to publish frequently and openly---a sample of existing publications can be found [here](http://openforcefield.org/publications).

The [Open Force Field Initiative](http://openforcefield.org) is a multi-investigator collaboration that aims to build new, quantitatively accurate molecular mechanics force fields supported by a modern software infrastructure, built on principles of open source, open data, and open science. More about their scientific goals and plans can be found in the Open Force Field Initiative [Executive Summary](https://openforcefield.org/science/downloads/roadmap/open-forcefield-summary.pdf) or [Roadmap](https://openforcefield.org/science/downloads/roadmap/open-forcefield-plan.pdf).

### Desired qualifications

* Experience with the theory and practice of atomistic biomolecular simulation using molecular mechanics force fields
* Comfortable with the Python programming language
* Exposure to [modern open source software development practices](https://github.com/choderalab/software-development) ([GitHub](http://github.org), unit tests, continuous integration)
* Good multidisciplinary teamwork and communication skills

### Bonus qualifications (nice to have, but not required!)

* Experience with force field parameter fitting for small organic molecules
* Experience with quantum chemical calculations in general, and [psi4](http://www.psicode.org/) in particular
* Experience with high-performance computing clusters and/or cloud computing
* Knowledge of organic chemistry
* Experience with the open-source GPU-accelerated molecular simulation Python library [OpenMM](http://openmm.org)
* Experience with probabilistic programming languages (e.g. [PyMC](https://github.com/pymc-devs), [TensorFlow Probability](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/overview), [Pyro](http://pyro.ai/)) and/or machine learning frameworks like [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org) or [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* Experience with cheminformatics or computer-aided drug discovery

### Location

Open Force Field Initiative postdocs will generally have flexibility in location, with potential sites including the participating investigator laboratories:

* [Michael K. Gilson](http://gilson.cloud.ucsd.edu/) (UCSD, La Jolla, CA)
* [John D. Chodera](http://choderalab.org) (MSKCC, New York City, NY)
* [Lee-Ping Wang](https://chemistry.ucdavis.edu/people/lee-ping-wang) (UCD, Davis, CA)
* [David L. Mobley](http://mobleylab.org) (UCI, Irvine, CA)
* [Michael R. Shirts](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/shirtsgroup/) (University of Colorado, Boulder, CO)

### Appointment duration

The initial appointment will be for one year, with the potential for extension to multiple years to focus on other aspects of force field science and engineering. Position is pending final approval of funding.

### Applying

Interested candidates should email an application to `openforcefield@choderalab.org` with the subject line “Postdoc application” that includes:

* a cover letter explaining your motivation, background, and qualifications for the position
* a detailed Curriculum Vitae (including a list of publications)
* contact information of two references
