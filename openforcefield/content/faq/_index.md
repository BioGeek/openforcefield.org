## How can I use the research products of the Open Force Field Consortium (papers, data, software)? 

Everything that we develop will be fully open source under permissive licenses. Our codes are all distributed with the MIT or BSD-3 license, and written materials are made available under CC-BY 4.0.

## I am interested in contributing some codes to the Consortium.  Will I retain the right to use my codes for commercial research and products?

Because the MIT or BSD-3 software licenses permit commercial use, any codes distributed by the Consortium may be used in commercial products.

## How can I join the Open Force Field Consortium as an Industry Partner?

See the [Open Force Field Consortium](../consortium/) page for more information on how to join.

## How can I join the Open Force Field Consortium as an Academic Investigator?

Get in touch with one of the [current Open Force Field Investigators](../members/) if you're interested in joining as an investigator.

## What molecular simulation packages will your force fields work in?

The reference implementation of the [SMIRNOFF](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/topology/smirnoff.html) force field specification can produce parameterized small molecules in a variety of commonly supported formats, including support for [OpenMM](http://openmm.org), [AMBER](http://ambermd.org), [CHARMM](http://www.charmm.org), [Gromacs](http://www.gromacs.org), and [NAMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/), thanks to the open source conversion tools [ParmEd](https://parmed.github.io/ParmEd/) and [InterMol](https://intermol.readthedocs.io/).

## Where can I find more information about your development timeline?

See our [science page](../science/) for the latest scientific roadmap.

## How can I stay up to date with Open Force Field Initiatve activites and developments?
