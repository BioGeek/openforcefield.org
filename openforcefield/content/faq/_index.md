## How can I stay up to date with Open Force Field Initiatve activites and developments?

You can sign up for your mailing list [here](http://eepurl.com/dHzukb).

## What molecular simulation packages will your force fields work in?

The reference implementation of the [SMIRNOFF](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/topology/smirnoff.html) force field specification can produce parameterized small molecules in a variety of commonly supported formats, including support for [OpenMM](http://openmm.org), [AMBER](http://ambermd.org), [CHARMM](http://www.charmm.org), [Gromacs](http://www.gromacs.org), and [NAMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/), thanks to the open source conversion tools [ParmEd](https://parmed.github.io/ParmEd/) and [InterMol](https://intermol.readthedocs.io/).

## Where can I find more information about your development timeline?

See our [science page](../science/) for the latest scientific roadmap.

## How can I join the Open Force Field Consortium as an Industry Partner?

If you would like to join the Consortium as an Industry Partner, see the [Open Force Field Consortium](../consortium/) page.

## How can I join the Open Force Field Consortium as an Academic Investigator?

If you would like to join the Consortium as an Academic Investigator, contact one of the [current Open Force Field Investigators](../members/).
