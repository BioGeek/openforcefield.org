## How can I join the Open Force Field Consortium as an Industry Partner?

See the [Open Force Field Consortium](../consortium/) page for more information on how to join.

## How can I join the Open Force Field Consortium as an Academic Investigator?

Get in touch with one of the [current Open Force Field Investigators](../members/) if you're interested in joining as an investigator.

## What molecular simulation packages will your force fields work in?

The reference implementation of the [SMIRNOFF](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/topology/smirnoff.html) force field specification can produce parameterized small molecules in a variety of commonly supported formats, including support for [OpenMM](http://openmm.org), [AMBER](http://ambermd.org), [CHARMM](http://www.charmm.org), [Gromacs](http://www.gromacs.org), and [NAMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/), thanks to the open source conversion tools [ParmEd](https://parmed.github.io/ParmEd/) and [InterMol](https://intermol.readthedocs.io/).

## Where can I find more information about your development timeline?

See our [science page](../science/) for the latest scientific roadmap.

## How can I stay up to date with Open Force Field Initiative activites and developments?

You can sign up for our mailing list [here](http://eepurl.com/dHzukb).

## What is the difference between the Initiative and the Consortium?

The Open Force Field Initiative includes everyone supported by and/or working with the initiative; thus, we use the term "Initiative" to refer to the whole project and everyone involved, including commercial partners and scientific plans. The "Consortium" is the group of people and entities involved in the formal project/funding initiative.
